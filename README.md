[![PR's Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/MLPrep/pulls)

MLPrep is a mobile app that offers recipe recommendations based on a picture of the ingredients, aimed to help reduce food waste by helping users figure out a meal that maximize the usage of their available ingredients ðŸ¥—. Using machine learning, MLPrep eliminates the manual work and allows users to simply take a picture of the ingredients they want to cook with ðŸ“·, and our app will automatically recognize the ingredients in the picture and generate recipes accordingly.
